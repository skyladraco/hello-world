# hello-world

Hey there,

This is my first time coding more than a wiki or a web page. I am looking forward to learning more and growing my coding skills. 
I'm a hand drummer and lyricist who also loves to sword fight. Technology is in my veins so I Love what I do for a living, which has been desktop and server support for 17 years, but it is nice to unplug and go camping, drum around a camp fire and spin.
